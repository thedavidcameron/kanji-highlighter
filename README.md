kanji-highlighter
=================

This is a Greasemonkey userscript which highlights kanji on websites based on the user's knowledge. This makes it easy to determine the difficulty of sentences and indicate when you will be able to read them entirely.

The script is optimized for users who learn kanji in a set order, and by default matches the levels of the [WaniKani] website. Future updates will look to expand into more general kanji lists such as JLPT and Joyo grades.

Here, all kanji that are already classified as known are not highlighted green. A yellow shade means that a kanji will be learned very soon using the specified order, and red means that it can be found in the latter half of the remaining kanji. Grey means that the kanji is not part of the list used.
