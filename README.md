kanji-highlighter
=================

This is a Greasemonkey userscript which highlights kanji on websites based on the user's knowledge. This makes it easy to determine the difficulty of sentences and indicate when you will be able to read them entirely.

The script is optimized for users who learn kanji in a set order, and by default matches the levels of the [WaniKani] website. Future updates will look to expand into more general kanji lists such as JLPT and Joyo grades.

Here, all kanji that are known are now highlighted in green. Kanji that will be learned soon are highlighted in yellow whilst red is used for the latter half of remaining kanji. If a kanji is highlighted in grey, this kanji is not on the learning lists used.
